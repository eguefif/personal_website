        <p class="md">Websockets are a convenient way to maintain a connection between a server and a client using all the existing HTTP infrastructure. In this article, we'll cover the basics of a working WebSocket echo server. We will cover the handshake and frame concept.</p><p class="md">Here are some links:</p><ul class="md"><li class="md"><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455" class="md">RFC 6455</a></li><li class="md"><a href="https://github.com/eguefif/ws-echoserver-rust" class="md">complete project code</a></li></ul><h2 class="md">The server Handshake</h2><h3 class="md">A basic TCP server</h3><p class="md">I like to start by thinking about how I'll use the code I write. In our case, we want to run a server. Let's write our server's main:</p><code class="md">fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    run_server("127.0.0.1", 8000)?;
    Ok(())
}
</code><p class="md">By doing so, we get an idea of what our entry point looks like and the parameters it needs. Let's add the following function to this file.</p><code class="md">use std::net::TcpListener;
use std::thread;

pub fn run_server(ip: &str, port: u32) -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind(format!("{}:{}", ip, port))?;
    for stream in listener.incoming() {
        match stream {
            Ok(socket) => {
                thread::spawn(move || println!("Handling new connection: {:?}", socket));
            }
            Err(e) => eprintln!("Error: {e}"),
        }
    }

    Ok(())
}
</code><p class="md">This function creates a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/struct.TcpListener.html" class="md">TcpListener</a> and anytime a new connection is opened with a client, it spawns a new thread to handle it.</p><p class="md">Let's test it with telnet:</p><code class="md">$ telnet 127.0.0.1 8000
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to 127.0.0.1.
Escape character is '^]'.
Connection closed by foreign host.
</code><p class="md">It worked, meaning that our basic TCP server handled a new connection.</p><h3 class="md">Reading an HTTP request</h3><p class="md">From now on, we will use Postman to craft WebSocket packets. Here is the download <a href="https://www.postman.com/downloads/" class="md">link</a>. The software is free.</p><p class="md">Let's read our socket until the end of the HTTP header. We won't go through the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112" class="md">RFC 9112</a>. We need to know that an HTTP header is terminated by the <span class="md line-code">\r\n\r\n</span>. Let's refactor our code a little bit. We will first create a handle<em class="md">client function and a WebSocket structure</em></p><p class="md">Here is our new <span class="md line-code">run_server</span> function and the new <span class="md line-code">handle_client</span> function:</p><code class="md">use std::net::TcpListener;

fn run_server(ip: &str, port: u32) -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind(format!("{}:{}", ip, port))?;
    for stream in listener.incoming() {
        match stream {
            Ok(socket) => {
                // Instead of printing, we handle the client
                thread::spawn(move || handle_client(socket));
            }
            Err(e) => eprintln!("Error: {e}"),
        }
    }

    Ok(())
}

use std::net::{TcpListener, TcpStream};

fn handle_client(socket: TcpStream) {
    let mut websocket = WebSocket::new(socket);
    loop {
        // Let's keep it simple for now, the unwrap is a good 
        // way to focus on the logic first and a reminder of 
        // what we need to do.
        let payload = websocket.try_read_frame().unwrap(); 
        websocket.send_frame(payload);
        break
    }
}

</code><p class="md">Now that we know what we need, let's create our WebSocket module in a separate file. Don't forget to add the module in the main.</p><code class="md">use std::net::TcpStream;

pub struct WebSocket {
    socket: TcpStream,

        todo!();
    }

    pub fn send_frame(&mut self, payload: String) {
        todo!();
    }
}
</code><p class="md">The <span class="md line-code">try_to_read_frame</span> and <span class="md line-code">send_frame</span> functions will be covered in the next article. Let's focus on the handshake. We will put the logic in our <span class="md line-code">new</span> function.<br/>We want to read the first HTTP request and print it. Let's add some logic to that.

</code><p class="md">It's pretty self-explanatory. Let's write the function <span class="md line-code">read_http_request</span>. This one won't be in our Struct. It's not directly related to the WebSocket. It does not need to manipulate any of the <span class="md line-code">WebSocket</span> struct attributes.

We just want to do an echo server. Let's skip that part and go straight to the point. All we want is the client's handshake key. Before going any further, let's write a plan a bit ahead. We want to extract the key and then craft an HTTP header that we will return to the client.</p><code class="md">// We need to import the Write trait for write_all
use std::io::{Read, Write};

</code><p class="md">First, let's tackle the key extraction. If we look at what Postman sent us, we can determine how to extract the key. Let's get a look at it.</p><code class="md">GET / HTTP/1.1

</code><p class="md">Again, we use a lot of <span class="md line-code">expect</span> to focus on the logic.

</code><h3 class="md">How to process the key for the client</h3><p class="md">The only information we need to respond is the <span class="md line-code">Sec-WebSocket-Key</span>. This is a string. We will discuss the client part in the next section on how to make it. The server just needs to process it a certain way. The RFC explains how to do it with an example. Let's quote it:</p><div class="md quote">A |Sec-WebSocket-Accept| header field.  The value of this header field is constructed by concatenating /key/, defined above in step 4 in Section 4.2.2, with the string "258EAFA5- E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11", taking the SHA-1 hash of this concatenated value to obtain a 20-byte value and base64-encoding (see Section 4 of <a href=" this 20-byte hash." class="md">RFC4648</a></div><p class="md">To summarize, here is a pseudo code:<br/>guid = "258EAFA5- E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11"<br/>concatenated<em class="md">key = concatenate(client</em>key, guid)<br/>digest = sha1(concatenated<em class="md">key)
processed</em>key = bas64.encode(digest)</p><p class="md">The RFC explains why we do that. It is to be sure that a server can handle WebSockets. This is not for security reasons. The client will check the key returned by the server, and if the expected value is correct, it will start sending frames.</p><p class="md">The RFC gives an example. Let's use it as a test case for our code. The client key is dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==. At the end of the process, it will be: s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo=.</p><code class="md">fn process_key(key: &str) -> String {
    "place holder".to_string()
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod test {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn it_should_processed_key() {
        let client_key = "dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==";
        let expected = "s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo=";

        let result = process_key(client_key);
        assert_eq!(result, expected);
    }
}
</code><p class="md">Everything is done in the <span class="md line-code">websocket.rs</span> file. We added the function we want with some dummy values. Let's run the test first, and you'll see that it fails. Let's write the logic now.<br/>To make it work, we need to use the base64 and the sha1 crates. You can add the following to your <strong class="md">cargo.toml</strong>:</p><code class="md">[dependencies]
base64 = "0.22.1"
sha1 = "0.10.6"
</code><p class="md">Let's write our key processing function.</p><code class="md">use sha1::{Digest, Sha1};

</code><p class="md">When we run our test, we can see that it works. The first time I tried to do that, it took me something like 4 or 5 hours. I was making a HashMap of all the headers. For some reason, I decided to lowercase every key/value entry. That was a very bad idea, even though my unit test passed, the program was returning the wrong key because I was making the server key from a lowercased version of the client's key. When someone writes something in an RFC, you stick to the spelling and do not try to be smarter. I thought that using capital letters was error-prone. I've learned my lesson. From now on, I will stick to the standard as much as I can.</p><h3 class="md">Writing our response request.</h3><p class="md">According to the RFC, the server must respond with an HTTP packet that contains a response line and headers ended by <span class="md line-code">\r\n\r\n</span>.</p><code class="md">HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols\r\n

Handshake done
</code><p class="md">It worked. Nice job. We just made a working WebSocket handshake. From now on, our server and client will only communicate using frames. We'll see what it looks like in the next article.</p><h2 class="md">Conclusion</h2><p class="md">The huge benefit of WebSocket is that, once the handshake is done, the TCP/TLS connection stays open. These two protocols carry some overhead. They have a handshake on their own, and the TLS adds some encryption. When we use WebSockets, we don't have to redo the TCP and TLS handshake, which saves time. It's faster.</p>
